Task Overview:

- Given the mocks and boilerplate provided, build an interface to 
display a list of employees and the ability to add new employees to that list.

Get Started:

- Run npm install.
- Run yarn start.
- Initial employee data is stored in src/data/users.js.
- Mocks are in the src/mocks folder.

Expectations:

- App's initial view displays a list of employees.
- You can navigate back and forth between the Employees list view and the Add Employee view.
- Upon successfully adding an employee, you are taken to the Employees list view.
- Make sure to do (basic) email validation (when adding a new employee).
- Use the 'Search by name' text input to filter the employees by their names.

Key Points:

- Focus on file structure, state management, shared state.
- Create basic, reusable components.
- Write production-level code.
- 3rd party dependencies are not required, but feel free to add any if you think 
they are necessary.
- Feel free to get creative with your solution.
